# VHDLRepo


This repository aims to collect the VHDL code i've been writing during my Logic Circuit course.

> VhdlLab contains the code made during the labs at university.

> BasicEntities contains the code i've been writing on my own to be able to speed up my workflow using the structural style rather than dataflow while building components requiring as the name suggests basi entities which are common among many programs.

>Esercitazioni contains all the code i wrote during in class training.
